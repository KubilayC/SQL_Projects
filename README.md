This repository contains multiple analyses on different topics, each organized into separate files. The files are numbered sequentially (1_, 2_, etc.) to illustrate my progression and approach to various data analysis tasks.

This repository includes an analysis of the HR dataset focusing on:
- Employee Distribution: Breakdown of employees across different departments.
- Commuting Distances: Categorization of employees' distances from home and its impact on overtime.
- Education vs. Department: Relationship between employees' educational backgrounds and their current departments.
- Job Roles Analysis: Examination of job roles in relation to employees' education.
- The analysis uses SQL queries and CTEs to provide insights into workforce distribution, commuting patterns, and the influence of education on job roles.
