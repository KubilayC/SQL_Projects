--In the dataset, since there is no primary key, I created a manual primary key and made adjustments to some columns for ease of use.

/*ALTER TABLE hr_employee
CHANGE  ï»¿Age AGE INT

ALTER TABLE hr_employee
DROP COLUMN EmployeeNumber

ALTER TABLE hr_employee
ADD id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;*/
